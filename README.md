ABOUT THE PROJECT:

🎵 Music Genre Classification

🔍 Task 4 - ML Model (CodTech Internship)

This project is part of my internship at **CodTech**, where I implemented a machine learning model using **Scikit-learn** to predict the genre of a song based on its audio features.

---

🎯 Project Goal

To build a predictive model that classifies songs into genres like:
- **Pop**
- **Hip-Hop**
- **Electronic**

based on features such as BPM, Energy, Danceability, Loudness, Valence, and more.

---

⚙️ What I Did

I started by creating a small custom dataset with numerical features for a few sample songs. Then I:
- Encoded the genre labels,
- Scaled the feature values,
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**, and
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.

I also tested the model on new inputs to predict genres based on sample features.

🧠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas & Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

✅ What I Learned

This task helped me understand the complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Even though the dataset was small, it was a great way to practice classification and see real results.
